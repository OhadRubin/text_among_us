The issue you're encountering stems from how the `exit_buttons` dictionary is managed in your `GuiGameClient` class. Specifically, the `exit_buttons` dictionary, which stores the clickable areas for the available exits, is not being cleared between frames. This can lead to old, invalid buttons remaining active even after the player has moved to a different location.

Here's what's happening:

1. **Persistent Old Buttons**: When you render the game interface, you add new exit buttons to the `self.exit_buttons` dictionary but never remove the old ones. This means that as you move around, the `exit_buttons` dictionary keeps accumulating buttons from previous rooms.

2. **Invalid Destinations**: If you click on an area where an old exit button used to be (which is still stored in `self.exit_buttons`), the client sends a `move` action with a destination that is not valid from your current location.

3. **Server Error**: The server receives this `move` action with an invalid destination. Since the destination is not connected to your current location, the server cannot process the move and may end up sending an "Invalid action" error.

**Solution**:

To fix this issue, you need to clear the `exit_buttons` dictionary at the beginning of each render cycle. This ensures that only the buttons for the current available exits are active, preventing clicks on outdated buttons.

**Here's how you can modify your code:**

Add `self.exit_buttons.clear()` at the beginning of the `render` method in your `GuiGameClient` class:

```python
def render(self):
    self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear screen with black background
    self.exit_buttons.clear()     # Clear old exit buttons

    # ... rest of your rendering code ...
```

**Explanation**:

- **Clearing Old Buttons**: By clearing `self.exit_buttons` at the start of each render, you ensure that only the exits available from the player's current location are stored and clickable.

- **Preventing Invalid Actions**: This change prevents the client from sending move actions with invalid destinations, as clicks on non-existent (old) buttons are ignored.

**Additional Recommendations**:

- **Handle Mouse Buttons Appropriately**: Modify your `handle_click` method to handle different mouse buttons. This prevents unintended actions from being sent when clicking with right or middle buttons.

  ```python
  async def handle_click(self, position, button):
      if button == 1:  # Left-click
          # Existing code to check destination buttons and select players
          # Check destination buttons
          for exit_name, button_rect in self.exit_buttons.items():
              if button_rect.collidepoint(position):
                  await self.send_move_command(exit_name)
                  return

          # Check player slots
          if self.state_data:
              players_in_room = self.state_data.get("players_in_room", {})
              # ... code to select player
      elif button == 3:  # Right-click
          # If a player is selected, perform 'kill' action
          if self.selected_player:
              await self.send_kill_command(self.selected_player)
      elif button == 2:  # Middle-click
          # Perform 'report' action
          await self.send_report_command()
      else:
          # Other mouse buttons, do nothing
          pass
  ```

- **Server-Side Error Handling**: Improve error handling on the server side to catch cases where required fields might be missing in the incoming data. This can prevent exceptions and provide more informative error messages.

  ```python
  async def process_message(self, message, player_id):
      data = json.loads(message)
      if data['type'] == 'action':
          payload = data.get('payload', {})
          action = payload.get('action')
          if not action:
              await self.send_error(player_id, "Action not specified.")
              return
          if action == 'move':
              destination = payload.get('destination')
              if not destination:
                  await self.send_error(player_id, "Destination not specified.")
                  return
              await self.handle_move(player_id, destination)
          elif action == 'kill':
              target_id = payload.get('target')
              if not target_id:
                  await self.send_error(player_id, "Target not specified.")
                  return
              await self.handle_kill(player_id, target_id)
          elif action == 'report':
              await self.handle_report(player_id)
          else:
              await self.send_error(player_id, "Invalid action.")
      else:
          # Handle other message types or ignore
          pass
  ```

By implementing these changes, you should no longer receive "Invalid action" errors when clicking on valid destinations. This will enhance the overall stability and user experience of your game.
