# Update 6: Security Enhancements and Configuration Options

### **Objective**

Implement security measures, finalize game features, and introduce configurable game settings.

### **Server Components**

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**
  - Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and invalid actions.

- **Role-Based Action Verification**
  - Ensure players can only perform actions permitted by their role and game state.

- **Fog of War Implementation**
  - Limit information sent to players based on their location and line of sight.

- **Secure Connections**
  - Upgrade to **Secure WebSockets (`wss://`)** to encrypt data transmission.

- **Configuration Options**
  - Implement server-side settings for:
    - **Impostor count**
    - **Task quantity and types**
    - **Discussion and voting times**
    - **Vote anonymity**
    - **Ghost mechanics**

### **Client Components**

- **Error Handling**
  - Provide informative error messages for invalid commands or actions.

- **Dynamic HUD Adjustments**
  - Adjust displays based on game configurations (e.g., show/hide certain HUD elements).

### **Security Measures**

- **Server Authority**
  - Maintain the server as the authoritative source for all game state.

- **Data Encryption**
  - Use SSL/TLS certificates to secure WebSocket communications.

### **Technical Requirements**

- **Unit Testing Framework**
  - Utilize `unittest` or `pytest` for comprehensive testing of all components.

- **Logging and Analytics**
  - Implement detailed logging with different levels (info, warning, error).
  - Collect analytics for game metrics and performance monitoring.

- **Documentation**
  - Provide thorough documentation for code, APIs, and configuration settings.

### **Game Mechanics Finalization**

- **Ghost Mechanics**
  - Finalize features for dead players based on configurations:
    - **Ghost chat**: Allow dead players to communicate separately.
    - **Task completion**: Enable or disable ghosts completing tasks.

- **Win Condition Enhancements**
  - Refine conditions for tie scenarios or special circumstances.
