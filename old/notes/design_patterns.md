# Design Patterns for Game Architecture

## 1. Event System
The game should implement a centralized event system to handle all game events and messages.

### Key Components:
- EventEmitter class to manage event subscriptions and dispatching
- Event types for all game actions (movement, kills, reports, etc.)
- Event handlers for processing each event type

### Benefits:
- Decoupled communication between components
- Easier to add new event types
- Simplified debugging and logging
- Better control over event flow

## 2. Communication Layer
Abstract all WebSocket communication into a dedicated layer.

### Key Components:
- Communication class handling all network operations
- Message serialization/deserialization
- Connection management
- Reconnection logic

### Benefits:
- Single point of control for network communication
- Easier to implement different transport protocols
- Simplified error handling
- Better connection management

## 3. State Pattern
Implement game phases using the State pattern.

### Game States:
- FreeRoamState
- DiscussionState
- VotingState
- GameOverState

### Benefits:
- Clear separation of phase-specific logic
- Simplified state transitions
- Easier to add new game phases
- Better control over phase-specific behaviors

## 4. Message Protocol
Standardize all game messages with a clear protocol.

### Message Structure:
- Type: The message category
- Payload: The message data
- Metadata: Additional information (timestamps, sequence numbers)
- Version: Protocol version

### Message Types:
- GameState
- PlayerAction
- SystemEvent
- PhaseChange
- Error

### Benefits:
- Consistent message handling
- Easier validation
- Better error detection
- Simplified client-server communication

## 5. Command Pattern
Implement game actions using the Command pattern.

### Commands:
- MoveCommand
- KillCommand
- ReportCommand
- VoteCommand
- EmergencyMeetingCommand

### Command Structure:
- Execute method
- Validate method
- Undo capability (where applicable)
- Command parameters

### Benefits:
- Encapsulated action logic
- Easy to add new actions
- Support for action validation
- Potential for action replay/undo

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order:
1. Message Protocol (foundation for communication)
2. Communication Layer (reliable message transport)
3. Event System (internal message handling)
4. State Pattern (game phase management)
5. Command Pattern (action handling)

### Integration Considerations:
- Commands should emit events through the event system
- States should handle relevant events for their phase
- Communication layer should enforce message protocol
- All components should use standardized error handling

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete game flows
- Protocol conformance tests

This architecture will result in a more maintainable and extensible codebase, making it easier to add features and fix bugs in the future.
