**Kill Mechanics Enhancement**

1. **Add Kill Cooldown Timer (Default 3s)**
   - **Purpose**: Prevent impostors from killing too frequently, adding strategic depth to gameplay.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Individual Cooldown**: Each impostor should have their own independent cooldown timer.
     - **Timer Start**: The cooldown timer begins either at the start of the game or immediately after performing a kill.
     - **Visual Indicator**:
       - Impostors should see a countdown timer displaying the remaining cooldown time.
       - The "Kill" button should be disabled or visually indicated as inactive during the cooldown period.
     - **Edge Cases**:
       - If an impostor tries to kill during the cooldown, a notification should inform them of the remaining cooldown time.
       - The cooldown should persist through game events like meetings or reports unless reset by game logic.

**Kill Mechanics Enhancement**

1. **Add Kill Cooldown Timer (Default 3s)**
   - **Purpose**: Prevent impostors from killing too frequently, adding strategic depth to gameplay.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Individual Cooldown**: Each impostor should have their own independent cooldown timer.       ```python
       # Add to GameServer class:
       self.kill_cooldowns = {}  # player_id -> timestamp of last kill
       self.KILL_COOLDOWN = 3  # seconds       ```
     
     - **Timer Start**: The cooldown timer begins either at the start of the game or immediately after performing a kill.       ```python
       # Update handle_kill method:
       async def handle_kill(self, killer_id, target_id):
           if not self.validate_kill(killer_id, target_id):
               await self.send_error(killer_id, "Invalid kill attempt")
               return
           
           current_time = time.time()
           if killer_id in self.kill_cooldowns:
               time_since_last_kill = current_time - self.kill_cooldowns[killer_id]
               if time_since_last_kill < self.KILL_COOLDOWN:
                   await self.send_error(killer_id, f"Kill cooldown: {self.KILL_COOLDOWN - time_since_last_kill:.1f}s remaining")
                   return
           
           self.kill_cooldowns[killer_id] = current_time
           self.player_status[target_id] = "dead"
           self.bodies[target_id] = self.players[target_id]["location"]       ```

     - **Visual Indicator**:
       - Impostors should see a countdown timer displaying the remaining cooldown time.
       - The "Kill" button should be disabled or visually indicated as inactive during the cooldown period.       ```python
       # Add to send_state_update method:
       if self.roles.get(player_id) == "Impostor":
           current_time = time.time()
           last_kill_time = self.kill_cooldowns.get(player_id, 0)
           cooldown_remaining = max(0, self.KILL_COOLDOWN - (current_time - last_kill_time))
           state_message["payload"]["kill_cooldown"] = cooldown_remaining       ```

     - **Edge Cases**:
       - If an impostor tries to kill during the cooldown, a notification should inform them of the remaining cooldown time.
       - The cooldown should persist through game events like meetings or reports unless reset by game logic.       ```python
       # Add to validate_kill method:
       def validate_kill(self, killer_id, target_id):
           if not (self.roles.get(killer_id) == "Impostor" and
                  self.player_status[killer_id] == "alive" and
                  self.player_status[target_id] == "alive" and
                  self.players[killer_id]["location"] == self.players[target_id]["location"]):
               return False
           
           current_time = time.time()
           if killer_id in self.kill_cooldowns:
               if current_time - self.kill_cooldowns[killer_id] < self.KILL_COOLDOWN:
                   return False
           return True       ```

2. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - **State Updates**: The cooldown timer should be included in state updates to clients
   - **GUI Client**: Update the GUI to show the kill cooldown timer visually
   - **CLI Client**: Add cooldown information to the status display

3. **Configuration**
   - Allow server-side configuration of cooldown duration
   - Consider adding different cooldown durations for different game modes or maps
